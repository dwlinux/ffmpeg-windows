This file describes some of the major features provided by
Linear Systems Ltd.'s SDI audio API.

What features does my board support?
====================================

The SDIAUDIO_IOC_TXGETCAP and SDIAUDIO_IOC_RXGETCAP ioctls
return bitfields which describe the capabilities of that interface.

Packing
=======

By default, two channels of audio are packed into
pairs of signed 16-bit little-endian words.
Other formats can be selected by changing the channels and sample_size
sysfs parameters.

Non-audio
=========

Non-PCM data such as AC-3 can be transmitted by setting the non_audio
sysfs parameter for each non-PCM channel.
