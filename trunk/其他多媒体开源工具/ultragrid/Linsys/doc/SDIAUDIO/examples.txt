Several example programs are provided in the Examples/SDIAUDIO directory
and are described below.


Ac3aes3
-------

NAME
	ac3aes3 - embed AC-3 frames in AES3 digital audio

SYNOPSIS
	ac3aes3 [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
	Ac3aes3 reads AC-3 frames from FILE or standard input,
	embeds them in 16-bit frame mode,
	and outputs two channels of 16-bit little-endian samples
	on standard output.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-i
		Display AC-3 frame information only, do not embed.
	-s STREAM
		Embed data stream STREAM.
		Possible values are 0..6.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Aes3data
--------

NAME
	aes3data - extract data bursts from AES3 digital audio

SYNOPSIS
	aes3data [OPTION]... [FILE]

DESCRIPTION
	Aes3data reads two channels of 16-bit little-endian words
	containing AES3 digital audio from FILE or standard input,
	extracts a 16-bit frame mode data stream,
	and outputs the data bursts on standard output.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-i
		Display data burst information only, do not extract.
	-s STREAM
		Extract data stream STREAM.
		Possible values are 0..7.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Audiocapture
------------

NAME
	audiocapture - example SDI audio receiver application

SYNOPSIS
	audiocapture [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Audiocapture reads data from DEVICE_FILE
	and writes it to standard output,
	while monitoring for SDI audio receiver events.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n TIME
		Stop after TIME seconds.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Audioplayout
------------

NAME
	audioplayout - example SDI audio transmitter application

SYNOPSIS
	audioplayout [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	audioplayout reads data from standard input
	and writes it to DEVICE_FILE,
	while monitoring for SDI audio transmitter events.

	At end-of-file, playout issues a fsync () to the interface.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n TIME
		Stop after TIME seconds.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Sdiaudiocfg
-----------

NAME
	sdiaudiocfg - configure an SDI audio interface

SYNOPSIS
	sdiaudiocfg [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Sdiaudiocfg uses the sysfs virtual filesystem
	to configure certain parameters
	of an SDI audio interface. If no options are given, sdiaudiocfg
	displays the current configuration of the interface.

OPTIONS
	-b BUFFERS
		Set the number of driver buffers on DEVICE_FILE to BUFFERS.
		There must be at least two buffers.
	-c CHANNELS
		Set the number of audio channels on DEVICE_FILE to CHANNELS.
		Possible values are 2, 4, 6, or 8.
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n NONAUDIO
		Set the non-audio flags on DEVICE_FILE.
		This is valid only for transmitters.
		There is one bit for each channel;
		0 represents PCM, 1 represents non-audio data.
	-r SAMPLERATE
		Set the audio sample rate on DEVICE_FILE.
		This is valid only for transmitters.
		Possible values are
		32000 (32 kHz),
		44100 (44.1 kHz),
		48000 (48 kHz).
	-s BUFSIZE
		Set the size of the driver buffers on DEVICE_FILE to
		BUFSIZE bytes. This must be a positive multiple of four.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.
	-z SAMPLESIZE
		Set the audio sample packing on DEVICE_FILE.
		Possible values are
		16 (pack samples into signed 16-bit little-endian words),
		24 (pack samples into signed 24-bit little-endian words),
		32 (pack samples into signed 32-bit little-endian words).


Sdiaudiorxcfg
-------------

NAME
	sdiaudiorxcfg - interactively issue SDI audio receiver ioctls

SYNOPSIS
	sdiaudiorxcfg [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Sdiaudiorxcfg is a simple program which demonstrates
	the SDI audio receiver ioctl commands.
	It can be used interactively to control or monitor
	an SDI audio receiver, or noninteractively
	with a script piped to its standard input.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.
