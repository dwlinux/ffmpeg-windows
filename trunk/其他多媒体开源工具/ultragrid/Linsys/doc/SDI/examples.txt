Several example programs are provided in the Examples/SDI directory
and are described below.


Capture
-------

NAME
	capture, mcapture - example raw SDI receiver application

SYNOPSIS
	capture [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

	mcapture [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Capture reads data from DEVICE_FILE
	and writes it to standard output,
	while monitoring for raw SDI receiver events.

	Mcapture uses mmap instead of read.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n TIME
		Stop after TIME seconds.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Playout
-------

NAME
	playout, mplayout - example raw SDI transmitter application

SYNOPSIS
	playout [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

	mplayout [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Playout reads data from standard input and writes it to DEVICE_FILE,
	while monitoring for raw SDI transmitter events.

	At end-of-file, playout issues a fsync () to the interface.

	Mplayout uses mmap instead of write.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-n TIME
		Stop after TIME seconds.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.


Sdicfg
------

NAME
	sdicfg - configure a raw SDI interface

SYNOPSIS
	sdicfg [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Sdicfg uses the sysfs virtual filesystem to configure certain parameters
	of a raw SDI interface. If no options are given, sdicfg
	displays the current configuration of the interface.

OPTIONS
	-b BUFFERS
		Set the number of driver buffers on DEVICE_FILE to BUFFERS.
		There must be at least two buffers.
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-m MODE
		Set the operating mode of DEVICE_FILE to MODE.
		Possible values are
		0 (8-bit precision),
		1 (pack four 10-bit words into five bytes).
	-s BUFSIZE
		Set the size of the driver buffers on DEVICE_FILE to
		BUFSIZE bytes. This must be a positive multiple of four.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.
	-x CLKSRC
		Set the clock source of DEVICE_FILE to CLKSRC.
		This is valid only for transmitters.
		Possible values are
		0 (onboard oscillator),
		1 (external reference clock),
		2 (recovered receive clock).


Sdirxcfg
--------

NAME
	sdirxcfg - interactively issue raw SDI receiver ioctls

SYNOPSIS
	sdirxcfg [OPTION]... DEVICE_FILE

DESCRIPTION
	Sdirxcfg is a simple program which demonstrates
	the raw SDI receiver ioctl commands.
	It can be used interactively to control or monitor
	a raw SDI receiver, or noninteractively
	with a script piped to its standard input.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-V
		Display the version information and quit.

	It can be used interactively to control or monitor
	a raw SDI transmitter, or noninteractively
	with a script piped to its standard input.

OPTIONS
	-h
		Display a help message and quit.
	-V
