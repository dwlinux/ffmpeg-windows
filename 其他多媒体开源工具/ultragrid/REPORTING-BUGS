There are couple of ways to report a problem:

* primary channel is an e-mail conference ultragrid-dev@cesnet.cz which leads
  to developers of UltraGrid
* you can use our bug-tracking system - https://sitola.fi.muni.cz/mantis/
  For reporting bugs, you need to register, but it is only matter of filling
  username and password

In order to allow us detect the problem more precisely, you can send us also 
output of diagnostic script (ultragrid/data/ultragrid-bugreport-collect.sh in
sources or /usr/share/ultragrid/ultragrid-bugreport-collect.sh once installed).

If the problem is a crash (SEGV), you can send also a core dump and a binary
(if you compiled by yourself, otherwise package version).
