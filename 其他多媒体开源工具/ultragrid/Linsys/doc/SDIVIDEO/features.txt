This file describes some of the major features provided by
Linear Systems Ltd.'s SDI video API.

What features does my board support?
====================================

The SDIVIDEO_IOC_TXGETCAP and SDIVIDEO_IOC_RXGETCAP ioctls
return bitfields which describe the capabilities of that interface.

Packing
=======

By default, video samples are packed in UYVY format.
Other formats can be selected by changing the mode sysfs parameter.

By default, only the region between SAV and EAV
on production lines is available to applications.
Alternatively, the region between SAV and EAV
on all lines can be included in order,
with frame boundaries occurring at field boundaries.
This gives access to the entire vertical ancillary space.
This is controlled by the vanc sysfs parameter.
When production lines are packed in UYVY format,
the other lines are packed in v216 format
to provide complete ten-bit words.
