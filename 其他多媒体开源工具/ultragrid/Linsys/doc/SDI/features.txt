This file describes some of the major features provided by
Linear Systems Ltd.'s raw SDI API.

What features does my board support?
====================================

The SDI_IOC_TXGETCAP and SDI_IOC_RXGETCAP ioctls
return bitfields which describe the capabilities of that interface.

Packing
=======

By default, four 10-bit samples are packed into every five bytes of data.
Samples can be handled with 8-bit precision
by changing the mode sysfs parameter.

Transmitter reference clock
===========================

By default, the onboard oscillator is used as a reference signal
for the transmitter. The external reference input
or the recovered receiver clock, if any, can also be selected
as a reference with the clock_source sysfs parameter.
