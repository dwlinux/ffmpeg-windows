1.1
=====
* support for specifying multicast interface for both IPv4 and IPv6
* IPv6 - support zone ID (RFC 4007), name resolving into IPv6
* LDGM - added profiles
* added acoustic echo canceller
* ALSA - fixed latency problem when using PulseAudio
* cmdline parameter to capture specified number of channels
* allow audio scaling (by a fixed ratio or adaptively)
* audio - added audio mapping/mixer
* Mac - produce complete self-contained bundle (with libs)
* updated GUIs - added FEC, tooltips etc.
* GL - hide cursor

1.1-rc4
=====
* interlacing - allow switching at field-rate while naturally interlacing field
* DeckLink - allow specification for audion input connection (SDI/AESEBU/analog)
* OpenGL - automatically enable sync on VBlank from application scope
* QT GUI - updated + allow compression setting
* added screen capture
* inserted packet mirror
* added possibility to limit sending bitrate
* added scaling postprocessor
* can be compiled with Clang/LLVM
* added LDGM

1.1-rc3
=====
* Mac - use native (Cocoa) context instead of GLUT
* added JACK audio devices
* DeckLink - add source selection (SDI/HDMI/Component/Compisite)
* switched to ITU-T BT. 709 Rec color space
* support for Mac OS X 10.7 (+ support for core 3.2 OpenGL profile)

1.1-rc2
=====

* updated documentation
* few small fixes

1.1-rc1
=====

* DeckLink - added format autodetection (not all cards support it, eg. Deck SDI
  does)
* added aggregate video capture/display - allows grabbing/displaying from 2 or more
  discrete cards. This allows eg. grabbing left eye with one grabbing card while
  right eye with another
* DVS - allow choosing input card (if there is more than one)
* Deltacast - format autodetection (perhaps all cards supported)
* Deltacast - added audio (both input and output)
* Mac OS X - enable DXT compression (with GL_EXT_GPU_SHADER4)
* modularized design - modules can be now build and installed independently from core
  UltraGrid - this allows i. a. distribution binary of UG with JPEG without knowing if
  target system has installed CUDA Toolkit.
* format detection for DVS cards
* DVS support for Mac OS X
